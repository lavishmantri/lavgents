# Workflow Ideas

## Handle my emails

- When an email arrives, read it classify it to appropriate category
  - Gmail webhook -> extract email -> LLM understands and matches against given categories, figure out new category if needed -> gmail API to apply label -> Log what is done in a DB

## Handle my expenses

- Upload bill on google drive, a script parses the document and extracts key information into a table
